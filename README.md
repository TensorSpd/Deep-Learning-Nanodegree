## **Overview**
This repository contains a collection of deep learning projects completed as part of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree program. The projects span various domains of deep learning, including neural networks, convolutional networks, recurrent networks, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and style transfer. Each project involves working with real-world datasets and applying deep learning techniques to solve complex problems.

## **Projects**

### **1. [Bike Sharing - Neural Network Regression](https://github.com/TensorSpd/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/tree/master/Bike_sharing)**
- **Dataset**: A dataset of daily bike rental ridership, including features such as temperature, humidity, and seasonal variations.
- **Objective**: To build a neural network model from scratch to predict daily bike rental counts based on various features like weather and time.
- **Outcome**: Successfully built a neural network to predict the number of daily rentals, achieving good performance and accuracy.

### **2. [Landmark Classification - CNN from Scratch & Transfer Learning](https://github.com/TensorSpd/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/tree/master/Landmark_classification)**
- **Dataset**: A dataset of images of global landmarks.
- **Objective**: To classify landmark images using a CNN model built from scratch, followed by improving performance through transfer learning.
- **Outcome**: The final model classified images of landmarks with high accuracy, significantly improved using ResNet50 for transfer learning.

### **3. [TV Script Generation - RNN for Text Generation](https://github.com/TensorSpd/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/tree/master/TV_script)**
- **Dataset**: A dataset of TV scripts from the Seinfeld series.
- **Objective**: To build an RNN (LSTM) model to generate Seinfeld-style TV scripts by learning patterns from the dataset.
- **Outcome**: The RNN generated realistic Seinfeld-style scripts, capturing the unique dialogue and style of the show.

### **4. [Style Transfer - Image Stylization with VGG19](https://github.com/TensorSpd/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/tree/master/style_transfer)**
- **Dataset**: Any content and style images provided by the user.
- **Objective**: To apply style transfer using the pre-trained VGG19 network, blending the content of one image with the style of another.
- **Outcome**: Successfully recreated images that maintain the content of the original while adopting the artistic style of a second image.

### **5. [CycleGAN - Image-to-Image Translation](https://github.com/TensorSpd/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/tree/master/winter2summer)**
- **Dataset**: Unpaired images from two different domains (e.g., summer and winter scenes of Yosemite).
- **Objective**: To implement a CycleGAN model for translating images from one domain to another (e.g., converting summer images to winter and vice versa).
- **Outcome**: The CycleGAN model generated realistic images translating between two domains without the need for paired datasets.
